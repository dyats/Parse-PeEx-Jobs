Bad quality of the deliverables or one of the business flow not only means trouble for the development team, but for the business as a whole, any big issue could cost a significant amount of money or the company’s reputation. Investing in the quality policy and related documentation, especially documentation that provides information about how to test, is crucial for any project and team desiring to succeed. Even though the process of creating such documentation would be driven by the quality or business team in some cases, it doesn’t suggest that development should not participate. In reality, the development team is one of the main stakeholders regarding the quality of the application and the features that would be delivered. They are essential knowledge keepers who can provide a better inside into the technical constraints and risks that could arise should the company decide to change or create a specific quality policy.</span></p>"

The release process itself is no trivial matter and different from application to application, from the cloud solution to the cloud solution, and a lot of the various issues, limitations, and risks should be considered during this process. For instance, when working with the releases, the developer should understand that even if the source code and the feature work correctly locally, it's not guaranteed to behave correctly after the release. Or deployment could fail, both new instance and old crash, or there is no versioning strategy and, as a result, no chance to quickly restore to the previous version. The mentioned issues above are just a few things that could arise within the release process and they should be considered by the development team and brought up to the respective stakeholders.</span></p>"
