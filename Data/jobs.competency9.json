One of the common challenges in an especially microservice architecture is establishing communication between the small applications in the most simple and performing way. Luckily, the cloud providers have a bunch of ready-to-use solutions. The standard solution for such challenges is a message queue that provides asynchronous indirect communication between the services and removes direct dependencies between them. Examples of message queue solutions are AWS SQS, Azure Queue Storage, and Google Task.</span></p>"

This involves creating a backend infrastructure that supports cloud-based storage and synchronization, setting up servers, databases, content delivery networks (CDNs), and APIs that allow the application to interact with the cloud storage solution. The engineer also needs to create client-side code that integrates with the application and handles the synchronization of data between devices, including designing data models, developing algorithms for conflict resolution, and implementing a syncing mechanism that allows changes made on one device to be propagated to all other devices. Additionally, security considerations must be taken into account, such as implementing appropriate encryption and access control mechanisms to ensure that sensitive user data is protected. By leveraging CDNs, the system can efficiently distribute data across multiple regions, providing users with faster access to data and improving the overall user experience. There are a lot of cloud software services to provide this functionality in an easy, serverless, or no-code way.</span></p>"

There are a few ways to adjust the configuration of infrastructure. The first is through the user interface and the second is through the code and solution such as Terraform or with a native or third-party solution built for the specific programming language. While UI is the most straightforward option, it could be unsuitable for the application under development. The common reasons are that not every cloud has a UI for specific tasks or tasks requiring a more detailed configuration that UI could not support. The reasons mentioned could force the team to start the configuration through the code instead of UI.
